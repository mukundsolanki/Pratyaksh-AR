Pratyaksh AR is an open-source project aimed at empowering individuals with hearing disabilities by offering a cost-efficient and technologically advanced solution. Our smart AR glasses enable real-time speech-to-text transcription in over 100 language pairs and feature custom keyword alerts, ensuring inclusivity in conversations and public announcements.

We have created smart AR glasses for people with Hearing disabilities which helps them in conversation as lip-reading alone is not enough to participate in group conversation therefore we have created real-time speech-to-text transcription in more than 100 language pairs. The biggest drawback we realized in the lives of the hearing impaired is not being able to listen to announcements, their name, and people out of their vision, So we have created CUSTOM BOOSTER KEYWORDS which will alert the user whenever that word is encountered.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Target Audience (incurable hearing disabilities)
- Presbycusis
- Traumatic Brain Injuries (Damage to ear drum)
- Sensorineural Hearing Loss
- Congenital Hearing Loss

## 🌟 Key Features  

- **🔊 Real-time Speech-to-Text:** Powered by Google Cloud STT API with 98% accuracy.  
- **🌐 Multi-Language Support:** Supports over 100 language pairs.  
- **⚡ Custom Booster Keywords:** Alerts users when specific words (e.g., their name) are detected.

### Future aspects
- WHO estimates hearing loss results in an annual global cost of $980 billion.
- Over 1 billion young adults are at risk of permanent hearing loss.
- Only 5% of Indian children with hearing disabilities attend school. Pratyaksh AR can bridge this gap by supporting higher education accessibility.
