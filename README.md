### Team Name: SyntaxSorcerers
### Team Number: 6167

## Problem Statement

A significant portion of the population faces difficulties in accessing information, communicating, and participating in daily activities due to physical or sensory limitations. Existing technologies, while helpful, may lack customization and the ability to seamlessly integrate with various aspects of life. Create a solution that can work together with the user to eliminate this problem.

## Solution

We have created smart AR glasses for people with Hearing disabilities which helps them in conversation as lip-reading alone is not enough to participate in group conversation therefore we have created real-time speech-to-text transcription in more than 100 language pairs. The biggest drawback we realized in the lives of the hearing impaired is not being able to listen to announcements, their name, and people out of their vision, So we have created CUSTOM BOOSTER KEYWORDS which will alert the user whenever that word is encountered.

### Target Audience (incurable hearing disabilities)
- Presbycusis
- Traumatic Brain Injuries (Damage to ear drum)
- Sensorineural Hearing Loss
- Congenital Hearing Loss


### Future aspects
- WHO estimates hearing loss poses an annual global cost of US$ 980 billion.
- Over 1 billion young adults are at risk of permanent hearing loss.

### Our Solution
- Low latency Speech-To-Text using Google Cloud STT API with an accuracy of 98% (Statista: WER of 2%)
- Multi-lingual with support of over 100 language pairs.
- Cost efficient with a cost of around 3,000 Rs, which is <10% of the competition.
- Speaker diarization for easy differentiation between speakers.
- CUSTOM BOOSTER KEYWORDS to make people completely independent by making a real-time keyword alert system.

### Economization

- Our product costs just 9.8% of what our competitors do. (XRAI AR glasses)
- XRAI AR glasses cost 30,000Rs+ vs Pratyaksh which costs around 3000Rs.
- The popular subscription for XRAI glasses is 5,357Rs per month whereas Pratyaksh costs around 1,200Rs per month with a 3-month free trial.
- XRAI AR is based on Nreal Air glasses, which leads to poor aftersales services by XRAI AR.



### Feasibility

- Special children after basic education and learning to read and write in special schools can use PRATYAKSH to continue their higher education normally as just 5% of Indian children with hearing disabilities attend school. 
- According to the WHO hearing disability is the most common form of sensory deficit.
